               <h2>How it all started..</h2>
               <p>Lacy came to us in Fall of 2019 at the age of 9. Being stuck in her ways, we had a difficult time figuring out what <b>a)</b >she enjoyed to eat, but also <b>b)</b> what kind of foods didn't upset her sensitive stomach. This led to several months of trial and error with several over the counter products, until we finally decided to try cooking her food and treats at home.</p>

               <p>Of course, more trial and error ensued after the next several months, but we finally narrowed in on a handful of recipes that she loves (and don't upset her sensitive belly).</p>

                <p>Living in Mid-Town Toronto (Forest Hill) in a crowded area of apartment buildings, we have come to meet many dogs in the neighbourhood. Not only that, we have met many <b>picky eaters</b>, just like Lacy (seriously, is there something in the water here?). <b>Our mission is to provide healthy and delicious treats to all the picky eaters in the City!</b></p>
